# Installing the MongoDB Shell

You already should have the mongo shell or "mongosh"

I have already installed this in the previous lecture.

The appearance will be difference but all the commands are the same

Recommend going with the MSI

This lecture also displays how to do this on MAC
* Move the mongosh and mongocryptd-mongosh to .../local/bin
